🚀 **Built a Real-Time Crypto Dashboard using CoinMarketCap API + Power BI** 📊

Recently, I created a dynamic cryptocurrency dashboard that pulls live data from CoinMarketCap using their public API.

🔗 The dashboard showcases:

* 💰 Real-time prices, volume, and market cap
* 📈 Percentage changes over multiple timeframes (1h to 90d)
* 🪙 Coin logos and metadata
* 🔄 Automated refresh using Power Query

🔍 Key Insight:
📈 It looks like Altcoin Season has officially begun!
One of the most notable trends from my analysis:

Memecore Coin has surged with a 552.18% gain over the past 90 days

🐧 Pudgy Penguin soared +504.63% in the past 90 days, now trading at just $0.0402.

💸 To put that into perspective:

👉 If someone had invested $100 in Pudgy Penguin 90 days ago:

Their investment would now be worth $604.63

That’s a 6x return in just 3 months 🔥

This kind of explosive growth highlights the volatility—and opportunity—within meme-based tokens during altcoin cycles.

These movements signal growing investor interest in niche and meme-based tokens.

All achieved using:
✔️ Power BI
✔️ M Code (Power Query)
✔️ CoinMarketCap Listings & Info endpoints (API)

It was a great hands-on project blending API integration with advanced data modeling and visual storytelling.

💬 Curious to see how I made it? Happy to share insights or the structure!
